Having seen numerous mistakes in oral scientific presentations, I decided to write a note with my supervisor, Prof. Budker, to summarize some good rules for making scientific viewgraphs. We produced *Some rules of good scientific viewgraphs* and uploaded it to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13134573).
