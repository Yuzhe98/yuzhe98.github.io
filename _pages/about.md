Welcome to my personal homepage! I am a physicist working on fundamental symmetries of nature, quantum sensing, and dark matter research.

## Research

I am currently working at the **Budker Group / CASPEr Project**, focusing on:  

- **Dark Matter Searches:** Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to search for axion-like particles (ALPs) and other ultralight dark matter candidates.  
- **Quantum Sensing:** Developing precision measurement techniques to probe spin precession in high- and low-field environments.  
- **Experimental Physics:** Managing liquid helium and nitrogen resources, calibrating magnetic field apparatus, and collaborating with international teams.  

Other projects include:  
- Collaborations with the **Helmholtz Institute Mainz** on precision magnetometry  
- Supporting other groups in **CASPEr-Gradient experiments** and NMR setups
