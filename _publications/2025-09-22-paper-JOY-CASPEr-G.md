**Abstract** 

We search for dark matter in the form of axionlike particles (ALPs) in the mass range $$5.576741\,\mathrm{neV}/c^2$$–$$5.577733\,\mathrm{neV}/c^2$$ by probing their possible coupling to fermion spins through the ALP field gradient. This is achieved by performing proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on a sample of methanol as a technical demonstration of the Cosmic Axion Spin Precession Experiment Gradient
(CASPEr-Gradient) Low-Field apparatus.

Searching for spin-coupled ALP dark matter in this mass range with associated Compton frequencies in a $$240\,\mathrm{Hz}$$ window centered at $$1.348570\,\mathrm{MHz}$$ resulted in a sensitivity to the ALP–proton coupling constant of $$g_{\mathrm{ap}} \approx 3 \times 10^{-2}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$$.

This narrow-bandwidth search serves as a proof-of-principle and a commissioning measurement, validating our methodology and demonstrating the experiment's capabilities. CASPEr-Gradient Low-Field will probe the mass range from $$4.1\,\mathrm{peV}/c^2$$ to $$17\,\mathrm{neV}/c^2$$ with hyperpolarized samples to boost the
sensitivity beyond the astronomical limits.
