**Abstract** 

The sensitivity and accessible mass range of magnetic resonance searches for axion-like dark matter depend on the homogeneity of applied magnetic fields. Optimizing homogeneity through shimming requires exploring a large parameter space, which can be prohibitively time consuming. The process of tuning the shim-coil currents has been automated by employing an algorithm based on Bayesian optimization. This method is especially suited for applications where the duration of a single optimization step prohibits exploring the parameter space extensively or when there is no prior information on the optimal operation point. Using the cosmic axion spin precession experiment-gradient low-field apparatus, it is shown that for the setup this method converges after ≈30 iterations to a sub-10 parts-per-million field homogeneity, which is desirable for our dark matter search.
