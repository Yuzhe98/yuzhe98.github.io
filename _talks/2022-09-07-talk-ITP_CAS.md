**Abstract:**  
Axion originated from a solution to the strong-CP problem, and in the past decade axions and other light pseudoscalar bosons (collectively referred to as axion-like particles or ALPs) have become well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidates. The Cosmic Axion Spin Precession Experiment (CASPEr) aims to probe axions and ALPs using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. CASPEr-Gradient in Mainz specifically searches for the coupling of nuclear spins to the gradient of the ALP field. The experimental apparatus was designed to scan the ALP Compton frequency from 100 Hz to 600 MHz, corresponding to an ALP mass range of approximately 10⁻¹³ eV to 10⁻⁶ eV. A 10-hour measurement was performed using a thermally polarized liquid methanol sample with a 25 ppm homogeneity at a 317 G leading field, corresponding to searching for an ALP field at 1.349533 MHz with a 33 Hz bandwidth. Noise levels of the setup and exclusions on the ALP coupling constant from this measurement have been analyzed. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
